- Ruby Synth is a collection of primitives to make electronic music with pure ruby.
- Ruby Synth is the backing project for my EuRuKo 2019 talk "The musical Ruby".
- Ruby Synth also contains a ton of additional writing to supplement the very dense 30 minute talk. You can read that additional material at [ruby-synth.fun](https://ruby-synth.fun).

Eventually I'll try to turn the primitives into a proper gem and better tests, but that will depend on your interest and if I can give this talk a couple of more times.

## Contributing or just playing around

- You'll need to install SoX
- You'll need Ruby 2.6.3 (it's an arbitrary choice and you could modify `.ruby-version` to make it run on older rubies, I don't use any 2.6 specific code)
- Most code is somewhat documented but I haven't yet built proper docs for it.
