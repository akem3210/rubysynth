# A warning
---
### Don't try to understand the code examples!

Note: This not meant as an insult. I'm just aware that it's a lot of code on very different subjects and it will be next to impossible to understand it during the presentation. Instead, go to [halfbyte/ruby_for_artists](https://github.com/ruby_for_artists) and study the examples there.

I'm providing the code fragments here to give you a sense of how much (or rather: how little) code is necessary and how the code looks in general. More of a teaser or taste bite than actually explaining how a library works.

The reason I have (in contrast to what every one tells you to do) a looong text on one slide is that I want to warn people who click through these slides later on.

(If you're sitting in the audience and you made it this far, please clap your hands twice.)

- Two problems:
  - Sampling frequency
    - Nyquist shannon, 2 * Fmax
    - ~ 40 kHz is enough, 20 kHz humans plus headroom
  - Sampling resolution
    - Enough is enough
