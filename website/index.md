# Ruby Synth

This is both a talk I've given at Euruko 2019 in Rotterdam, but also an open source project to build a fully functional ruby synthesizer in pure ruby. This Website primarily acts as further reading material for people who watched the talk.

You can find all source code, including the code for this website at [halfbyte/rubysynth](https://github.com/halfbyte/rubysynth) on GitHub.

## Credits

Thank you to Sam Aaron for [SonicPi](https://sonic-pi.net/)

Thank you to Lance Norskog for creating [SoX](sox.sourceforge.net/) and Chris Bagwell for maintaining it for more that 20 years now.

Thank you to the amazing [MusicDSP mailing list](http://musicdsp.org) of where most of the more complicated DSP code has found it's way into this project.
