                                <h1 id="drum-sounds">Drum Sounds</h1>
<p>We&apos;re now perfectly equipped to create some lush or harsh synthesizer sounds, so we should be able to make some good ambient music. But while I do like me some good ambient, I&apos;m more of a dance music kind of guy and for that we&apos;re missing an important part. Now, I could cheat here and just use sampling - That&apos;s what most dance music producers nowadays do, but that would be cheating, right?</p>
<p>Additionally, if you look at how music styles like House and Techno came about, they were literally based on the sounds of two drum machines, both from Roland, the TR-808 and the TR-909 - The 808 is using analog synthesis for everything while the 909 uses a limited amount of samples - So generating drums with the sythesizing technologies we&apos;ve explored so far would give us a good understanding of how these machines worked.</p>
<h1 id="kick-drum">Kick drum</h1>
<p>Let&apos;s start with the foundation of every house or techno groove, the bassdrum or kickdrum. If you analyze the sound of an accoustic kick drum (or basically any drum with a similar design with a drum head and a drum corpus), as if you were a Roland engineer in the 80&apos;s, you&apos;ll notice two very distinct parts of a drum sound. The sharp attack, when the drum stick hits the skin of the drum head, which is really more like a shark click and then the sound of the drum body, where the full body including the two skins (and the air trapped in them) vibrates.</p>
<p>To simulate these two parts, We can use a sine wave (or a filtered down squarewave) and quickly modulate it&apos;s pitch from a relatively high value to a relatively low value. By varying the speed and the two frequencies, we can get a surprising amout of different percussion sounds and some of them do sound like a bassdrum.</p>
<p>In this example, I&apos;ve also modulated the filter in a way so that it is a bit more open at the very beginning, adding to that sharpness of the first attack.</p>
<h1 id="snare-drum">Snare drum</h1>
<p>A snare drum is, together with the kick drum, the backbone of every rock groove. What a snare drum is, esentially, is a tom, so a midsized drum, that has a so called snare carpet that lies on the bottom drum skin. This leads to the characteristic noisy sound of a snare that is much more than just the sound of the drum, which would sound like this.</p>
<p>To construct a snare sound, we pretty much need two components - A version of our kick drum sound that is just slightly pitched up (as a smaller drum usually creates a higher pitche sounds), like this, and then something to emulate the snares. To me, this actually sounds a lot like white noise and so that&apos;s what we&apos;re going to use. White noise is surprisingly easy to create:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ruby">noise_out = rand * <span class="hljs-number">2.0</span> - <span class="hljs-number">1.0</span>
</code></pre>
<p>On top of that, we&apos;re going to emulate the snare wires being a bit more bright in the beginning and then dampening down while they settle by putting a lowpass filter on top with an envelope shaping the sound a little it. Of course I aso put another envelope on the volume.</p>
<h1 id="hihat">Hihat</h1>
<p>This is our last drum sound. The hihat, in a traditional drum kit, looks like this - It&apos;s essentially two cymbals on top of each other and you can move them together with a foot pedal, resulting in either very short or longer sounds.</p>
<p>Our hihat emulation will be somewhat crude, but it will actually work quite well within the groove we want to build with this.</p>
<p>Again, we&apos;ll start with white noise. Having a shorter or longer decay on our volume envelope gives us the chance to emulate an open or a closed hihat. By adding a static filter, a bandpass in this case, we can sort of tune the noise into something that at least starts to sound like a real hihat. To be honest, in my own music, I often favour these clean sounding hihats to accoustic ones.</p>
