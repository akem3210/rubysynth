# Sequencing basics

Now that we have our sound repertoire, we can start to think about how to turn these single sounds into actual music.

For that, we need to learn a little about sequencing and rhythm.

## A bar and a beat

Most modern dance music (as is most music you would hear on the radio) is writting in a straight 4/4 rhythm. But what does that mean?

It means that a measure (or bar) of our music is comprised of four quarter notes. A quarter note in in this measure represents a beat.

I'm not going to go into more detail about rhythm, because the 4/4 is so easy to work with and this can get complicated very quickly - just one quick example of a different beat, here's a 6/8 walz.

Tempo in music is often measured in beats per minute or short BPM. For 4/4, this very conveniently means that we can simply count the quarter notes. To make things even more simpler, we can stick to a very typical (for, say, slow house music) 120 BPM and thus we can determine that we'll need 2 beats per second, meaning that each beat is half a second long.

We can thus determinate that each beat will also be 24000 samples long.

## Patterns

Most modern dance music is developed on a basis of so called patterns. patterns, in this case mean small chunks of music, often a bar for example or multiples thereof, that can then be assembled into full songs. A pattern could be a drum pattern for example.

Here's an example of a bar of a typical house drum beat. basedrum plays on each quarter not, snare drum plays on the so called off beat, or, as musicians would say on the 2 and the 4 and the hihat fills in the gaps in the 8th notes between those sounds, with an open hihat closing out the pattern.

So to create a song, we first need a method to create patterns.
