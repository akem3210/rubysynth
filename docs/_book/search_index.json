start this off with a short demonstration of a software called SonicPi, which allows you to live code music:\n\n\nSonic Pi is a wonderful piece of software. It can teach both the basics of programming and the basics of music making while sounding quite professional. That's due to the great foundation Sonic Pi is based on: Supercollider is a system specifically built for live coding and has been under continuous development since 1996!\nBut today we're going to leave those comfortable foundations behind and going to try to recreate at least parts of it with pure ruby. The idea here is that we can use an expressive and easy to read language like ruby and show how to implement stuff that is usually written in C or C++, with lots of performance optimizations, which doesn't necessarily makes for the most readable code.\nWe're going to do this in three parts. At first we're going to take a look at how to generate typical synthesizer sounds, including some drum sounds. Next, we're going to figure out how to turn these into music by looking at sequencing (or, in old school terms, arranging). Last but not least we'll add some effects that will bring the sound to the pro level.\nI'll show a lot of code in this talk, but don't concentrate too much on it, though, it's all available for you to study afterwards. And, unfortunately, since we have a very full todo list for the rest of this talk, I need to glance over a couple of things I would have loved to talk about in detail - But fear not, the content is all there, if only in written form. If you go to ruby-synth.fun, you'll find a lot of additional material there, including, of course, all the code examples.\nMaking noise with Ruby\nRuby doesn't have a simple, integrated way of outputting sound directly to your computer's soundcard. While there may be libraries, I opted to use the power of Unix and leverage a tool called SoX, (short for \"Sound eXchange\"), which is essentially the swiss army knife of audio file conversion. It's been around for ages, I even used it back when I still had my AMIGA computer at the end of the 90's. Originally conceived by Lance Norskog, and then maintained by Chris Bagwell, it has thousands of contributors and is a great example for a long running open source project that does one thing and does it well. By playing around with Ruby's quirky Array#pack method and SoX's command line switches, I came up with the following snippet to make ruby output a binary stream of 32 bit, little endian float values:\nSAMPLING_FREQUENCY=44100\nFREQUENCY=440\n\nin_cycle = 0\nsamples = SAMPLING_FREQUENCY.times.map do\n  period = SAMPLING_FREQUENCY / FREQUENCY.to_f\n  output = in_cycle > 0.5 ? -1.0 : 1.0\n  in_cycle = (in_cycle + (1.0 / period)) % 1.0\n  output * 0.5\nend\nprint samples.pack('e*')\n\nwe then can use the following bash script that utilizes SoX's play command to pipe the output of the ruby script to your soundcard:\n#!/bin/bash\n# play.sh\nruby -Ilib $1 | play -t raw -b 32 -r 44100 -c 1 \\\n  -e floating-point --endian little -\n\n$ ./play.sh examples/square_wave.rb\n\nIf, instead of sending the data to our soundcard, we want to save it to a soundfile, to, for example, play the file from a webpage (how very self referential of me, right?), we can use the following snippet and invocation:\n#!/bin/bash\n# save.sh\nruby -Ilib $1 | sox -t raw -b 32 -r 44100 -c 1 \\\n  -e floating-point --endian little - -t wav -b 16 $2\n\n$ ./save.sh examples/square_wave.rb square_wave.wav\n\nIf you want to try this out yourself, you need to clone the repo and install SoX. I'm pretty sure this will work on Windows with either something like Cygwin or WSL, on any unix-ish system like Linux or MacOS, this should work fine. On Linux, SoX should be available from your package manager, on Mac, you can use Homebrew to install it.\n"},"02_what_is_sound.html":{"url":"02_what_is_sound.html","title":"What is Sound","keywords":"","body":"Even more low level than you thought...\nLet's see, what do you think what would be the easiest wavefor to generate using code? If your answer is \"A sine wave\", you completely underestimate the underlying challenge, so let's take a step back and figure out what we actually want to do.\nIf we want to generate a tone, that, later, will be used in a musical context, we'll need to generate a tone at a stable frequency. to do that we'll need to understand how digital sound works. We'll need to understand how sound works.\nI'll explain this in the reverse signal path, so let's start with the question of what sound itself is.\nWhat is sound\nSound, fundamentally, is air particles being moved in a way that can be detected by your ear. Usually we talk about sound waves, which means that the particles are being moved back and forth in a wave function.\nHere's a very crude graphical representation of this I threw together in Processing real quick:\n\n\nTo generate sound, you'll somehow need to get these air particles moving. You could do that by attenuating a string like on a guitar or in a piano, hitting a drum skin or a metal or wooden bar like in a marimba, but if we want to involve a computer here, it's pretty obvious that we somehow need to convert electrical signals into these particle waves.\nThe device you're looking for here is a loudspeaker. A loudspeaker has a magnetic coil which moves a large static magnet connect to a large membrane, also called the diaphragm, which then moves the air. The coil is driven by an analogue electric signal which is, essentially, an electric representation of the sound you're hearing.\n\nBut how do we get from the digital domain to the analogue domain? We'll need a DAC or Digital to Analog Converted which will turn a digital signal into an analogue signal. Nowadays, this is usually a small chip on your mainboard or on a soundcard. Here's one specific chip:\n\nBut here you're already seeing the main issue in this process - A digital signal is made off of discrete values at discrete moments in time - Analogue signals have nothing discrete about them, an analogue signal has an endless resolution in both the time and the amplitude domain * .\n\nThis is not entirely true. Analogue signals do have some boundaries as well, for example, electronic components will have a certain bandwidth in which signals can get processed cleanly. Also, a loudspeaker has technical limitations - with limited power, you can move a heavy magnet only so fast, which is the main reason most advanced speaker systems use different speakers for different frequency ranges - a small speaker is only good at reproducing high pitches, a large speaker is only good at reproducing low pitches.\n\nTo make this not sound like shit, we'll need to use a couple of tricks - First of all, not so tricky, both the time and the amplitude domain need to be high resolution enough so that the listener cannot hear the discreteness of the signals. To figure out how to do that, we first need to understand the boundaries of human hearing. Usually a good human ear can hear frequencies up to around 20 kHz. This gets worse the older you get as parts of your ear start to see some wear and tear and some people do hear higher frequencies, but this is a good baseline assumption. Ok, so large should our sample rate be? (meaning the number of different values per second) - Well, if the highest frequency we want to express is around 20 kHz, then it's quite easy to assume that we probably need to double that. Let's take a look at why that is. Imagine you want to express the highest frequency possible with a digital signal. You would want to essentially create a squarewave where each wave cycle is 2 \"samples\" long. Which gives you a tone at exactly half the sample rate.\nBut the digital signal of 20 kHz and the analogue signal look very different, right? Well, yes, they would, but if we know that the highest frequency we can express in a digital signal is half the sampling frequency, we can add analogue circuitry that will cut off frequencies past this point and end up with a signal that is much closer to the analogue representation.\nThis is the dumbed down version of what's called the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which has a Wikipedia page with a lot of formulas, if you need to flex your maths muscle.\nAs you know, the CD, which was the first commercially successful digital audio format, settled at 44.1 kHz, which gives you a maximum frequency of 22.05 kHz, which is at least completely outside of my own hearing range.\nFor the amplitude, most people are unable to hear (given a flawless DA process) differences in resolutions beyond 16 bit for most music, but here the story is a bit more complicated, because the human ear has an incredible dynamic range, meaning how well the human ear can hear both very loud and very quiet. The more dynamic range music has (classical pieces often have an incredible dynamic range with very quiet and very loud passages), the more difficult it becomes to cram music into 16 bits.\nOk, so we're now finally in the digital domain. So let's generate our first tone.\nFinally, let's look at some code.\nWe'll start with the simplest waveform we can generate in the digital domain. We've already seen it in the sampling frequency diagram, it's of course a squarewave.\nTo generates something that can be heard by ordinary people, let's cut the frequency down to a more manageable 440 Hz. Why that weird number? Well, 440 Hz is the so called Concert Pitch A, a more or less global standard for tuning instruments.\nOkay, well, let's talk about notes and pitches for a second, while we're at it.\nMost western music (important caveat!) is based on a scale of 12 so called half tones in an octave. The difference between an octave and the next is that the frequency doubles. So if the middle A is 440 Hz, the next A would be at 880 Hz, and the one below would be at 220 Hz.\n\nAll the other half tones are derived by various ratios that unfortunately don't add up perfectly. This leads to all kind of different compromises you can make to arrive at these 12 half tones and which scale or tuning you choose often also depends on your musical material. Most pop music uses the so called equal temperament which simply cuts the octave in twelve equal steps.\nThere's a simple formula to convert notes into frequencies, but uh, it has a number as input - This is a so called MIDI note number and it makes working with notes really easy, it simply counts half tones from a very low C, so 12 would be the next C, then 24, 36 etc. The middle C is 60, so the concert pitch A is 96.\n\n  \n    2n-6912*440Hz\n  \n\n\nOkay, let's finally go back to our tone. a note of 440 Hz has a period of 0.002272 seconds, which helps us because we can now determine that, given a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, each period of our wave is 100.227272727 samples long. Of course we could cheat and say that we would be ok with generating a tone with 441 Hz, because that would give us nice round numbers, but that would deny us an important lesson, namely the fact that it's quite important to keep your precision. So here, again, is the ruby code for generating a 440 Hz rectangle tone for exactly one second:\nSAMPLING_FREQUENCY=44100\nFREQUENCY=440\n\nin_cycle = 0\nsamples = SAMPLING_FREQUENCY.times.map do\n  period = SAMPLING_FREQUENCY / FREQUENCY.to_f\n  output = in_cycle > 0.5 ? -1.0 : 1.0\n  in_cycle = (in_cycle + (1.0 / period)) % 1.0\n  output * 0.5\nend\nprint samples.pack('e*')\n\nWe've essentially built what in Synth terms is called an \"Oscillator\". we're using the in_cycle variable as a counter that counts from 0 to 1 for each period, and then, at exactly 0.5, we're switching the polarity of our output.\nThere's one important caveat here that I'll ignore for the rest of this text, but is important to know: A pure square wave, as we're generating one here, has, by definition, an endless amount of so called overtones, expanding in the frequency spectrum way beyond our Nyquist-Shannon limits. This can lead to all kinds of weird artefacts (TODO: Find good explanation) which can be avoided by properly bandwidth limiting (essentially meaning filtering out all frequencies above the Nyquist-Shannon limit.) the waveform.\n"},"03_shaping_sound.html":{"url":"03_shaping_sound.html","title":"Shaping Sound","keywords":"","body":"sculpting a sound\nWhile this does sound like, uh, a tone, it certainly doesn't sound very pleasant. It's closer to an alarm sound than music. There are a couple of reasons why that is, let's tackle them one by one.\nFirst of all, a raw square wave is a very harsh sound in itself - We can probably improve upon that. What we need to do is to filter it down to something more mellow. The way we do that is by removing frequency content. Okay, time for some fundamentals again that will allow us to understand this a little better. If we want understand what's going on, it might make sense to try to graph the sound we're hearing in a different way. The oscilloscope style I've been using so far is useful for some things, but it only shows the so called time domain. We can transform this into the \"frequency domain\" and one way of doing that is the Fast Fourier transform. It's called fourier to honour Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, a mathematician who lived from 1786 to 1830 and did a lot of ground work in understanding how we can basicially divide every signal (in this case: sound) into a bunch of sinewaves at different frequencies and amplitudes. Here's how to build our square waves from a bunch of sinewaves and here's how that looks in the frequency domain. Oh, btw, that lowest frequency sine wave down there to the left? That's a sinewave at our 440 Hz frequency, also called the fundamental. Because it's the loudest of the sinewaves, it's what our brain interprets as the note that is played, even though a lot of other sinewaves are also played that are on completely different frequencies and notes.\nIf we want to make this sound less harsh, we can use a so-called filter to remove some of the more higher sine waves, because those are what make it sound harsh in the first place. For that, we'll need a low pass filter, that leaves the lower sinewaves intact.\nThe state variable filter\nOne rather popular algorhythm to do this is called a state variable filter. The following block diagram shows how it's internals work. Interestingly, this block diagram can be implemented both in software (as we'll see) and in electronics as well which is where this has been developed in the first place.\n\nHere's the main loop of the filter:\ndef run(input, frequency, q, type: :lowpass)\n  # derived parameters\n  q1 = 1.0 / q.to_f\n  f1 = 2 * Math::PI * frequency / @sampling_frequency\n\n  # calculate filters\n  lowpass = @delay_2 + f1 * @delay_1\n  highpass = input - lowpass - q1 * @delay_1\n  bandpass = f1 * highpass + @delay_1\n  notch = highpass + lowpass\n\n  # store delays\n  @delay_1 = bandpass\n  @delay_2 = lowpass\n  # [...]\nend\n\nThe cool thing with this filter is that with one run, you'll get four different filter types, a lowpass, a highpass, a bandpass and a notch or band reject. If you graph the frequency responses of these, they probably look a little like this:\n\n\n\n\nDid you notice the little hump right around the filter frequency? The state variable filter has a second parameter beyond the filter frequency, which is Q. What Q does is that it feeds back a bit of the filter result into the input. This leads to an emphasis around the actual filter frequency. If you crank Q way up, it will start to self-oscillate. This is also often called \"Resonance\".\nOften, especially when changing the filter frequency over time, upping Q a bit makes a sound more interesting.\nOkay, so this does sound a lot nicer, doesn't it, right? But something is not quite right yet. If you compare this sound with something like a piano sound, what's the most obvious difference, apart from the slightly more complex sound of the piano? It's the shape of the sound over time. A piano has a relatively sharp attack, then stays on for a bit and then fades out. You could say it has  certain envelope. Which is the name of the next piece of code we're going to discuss. An envelope shapes a sound in a certain way over time. You can influence any parameter in our sound generation so far with an envelope and you'll get an interesting result. Let's start with the most obvious: Making the volume of the sound fade in and out, resulting in less clicks and making it sound more natural.\nThere are endless ways of how to construct an envelope but the so called ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope sits right in the sweet spot of being very versatile and simple to parameterize. Here's what it looks like:\n\n\nHere's what the code looks like:\ndef linear(start, target, length, time)\n  (target - start) / length * time + start\nend\n\ndef run(t, released)\n  if !released\n    if t  a && t = a + d # sustain\n      return @value = s\n    end\n  else # release\n    if t  a && t = a + d && t = released + r # after release\n      return @value = 0.0\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nAnd here's what it sounds like if we shape the volume of the sound with this envelope. Much better, right?\nWhat else can we do with it? How about we'll modulate the filter frequency of our low pass filter? This emulates a lot of instruments such as the piano or a guitar where the sound starts relatively bright and then gets more muffled at the end.\nOf course, we could modulate the pitch of the note as well. Sometimes this works quite well with synthesizer sounds, but as we'll see, it will be invaluable for generating drum sounds.\nOne last thing that is very useful in sound design is a thing called an LFO. This stands for Low Frequency Oscillator and is exactly that, but instead of running these through a filter into the speakers, we'll use the output to modulate our parameters, such as the pitch, the filter frequency or the amplitude or volume.\nIf I use an LFO, for example, to modulate the filter, we're quickly getting into wub wub territory.\nUsed a little more subtly, on the pitch of our oscillator, gives us an effect called vibrato, which, for example, on a violin can be created by quickly, rhythmicly vary the position of your fingertip on the string every so slightly.\n"},"05_sequencer.html":{"url":"05_sequencer.html","title":"Building a Sequencer","keywords":"","body":"Sequencing basics\nNow that we have our sound repertoire, we can start to think about how to turn these single sounds into actual music.\nFor that, we need to learn a little about sequencing and rhythm.\nA bar and a beat\nMost modern dance music (as is most music you would hear on the radio) is writting in a straight 4/4 metric. But what does that mean?\nIt means that a measure (or bar) of our music is comprised of four quarter notes. A quarter note in in this measure represents a beat.\nI'm not going to go into more detail about rhythm, because the 4/4 is so easy to work with and this can get complicated very quickly - just one quick example of a different beat, here's a 6/8 walz.\nTempo in music is often measured in beats per minute or short BPM. For 4/4, this very conveniently means that we can simply count the quarter notes. To make things even more simpler, we can stick to a very typical (for, say, slow house music) 120 BPM and thus we can determine that we'll need 2 beats per second, meaning that each beat is half a second long.\nEach 16th note will thus be 1/8 of a second long. This is relevant because a 16th note is a very common unit used in so calles step sequencers, made popular by drum machines like the legendary Roland 808, pictured below, which used 16 buttons to make it easy to program these 16 steps in a bar in a very convenient manner.\n\nHere's how you would do the math in code:\nBPM = 120\nbeat_length_in_seconds = 60 / BPM # = 0.5s\nbar_length = beat_length_in_seconds * 4 # = 2s\nsixteenth_note_length = beat_length_in_seconds / 4 # = 0.125s\n\nPatterns\nMost modern dance music is developed on a basis of so called patterns. patterns, in this case mean small chunks of music, often a bar for example or multiples thereof, that can then be assembled into full songs. A pattern could be a drum pattern for example.\nHere's a screenshot of how that looks in a modern music production software, in this case Ableton Live, which I also use to produce music if I'm not programming it in Ruby:\n\nIn a way, you can think of patterns as abstractions that can be reused. Which brings us back to the question of how we could best represent this in code.\nLet's make a DSL for that.\nHere's some \"dream code\" to define a drum pattern:\ndef_pattern(:drums_full, 16) do\n  drum_pattern kick_drum,   '*---*---*---*---'\n  drum_pattern snare_drum,  '----*-------*---'\n  drum_pattern hihat,       '--*---*---*---*-'\nend\n\nThe following example is a first crude idea on how melody pattern definitions could look like:\ndef_pattern(:bassline, 16) do\n  note_pattern monosynth, [\n    ['C1', 4], P, P, P,\n    P, P, P, P,\n    ['C#1', 6], P, P, P,\n    P, P, P, P\n  ]\nend\n\nThe P in there is just a constant set to nil, and stands for \"Pause\". The array contains a note (note and octave) and a length in steps (or 1/16 notes).\nNow, let's take these pattern definitions and then turn them into a song:\nlength = song(bpm: 115) do\n  pattern(:drums_full, at: 0, repeat: 1)\n  pattern(:drums_full, at: 2, repeat: 2)\n  pattern(:bassline, at: 0, repeat: 4)\n  pattern(:chord, at: 0, repeat: 4)\nend\n\nSo, you can start a pattern at a certain position (specified in bars this time) and you can repeat them as many times as you want. Together with setting the tempo, this code can now schdule all notes to all the instruments.\nThe code to make this all work is a bit too long to list it all here, so please, by all means take a look at lib/sequencer_dsl.rb.\nAdditonally, take a look at lib/sound.rb which is the base class for every sound generator and among other things completely handles interpreting the scheduled events into a coherent view usable by the generator to use during rendering.\n"},"06_the_mixing_stage.html":{"url":"06_the_mixing_stage.html","title":"The Mixing stage","keywords":"","body":"The mixing stage\nTo be able to bring all of these instruments together, we'll need a mixer. A professional mixing desk (often also called a console, interesting, right?), usually consists of a large number of so called channel strips which is where the individual instruments come in. For each channel strip, you can make a huge range of adjustments, of which we'll be looking at a handful.\nVolume control\nThis one's easy. Different instruments come with different loudnesses. A bass drum is much louder than, say, a harp, just as a function of their physical attributes. The same is true for digitally created sounds. A bass sound that uses a high amount of filter resonance will be louder than other sounds, for example. But that's only the first problem. The second problem is that you usually don't want all sounds to have the same volume. A hihat often needs to be a lot quieter than other drum sounds, for example, because otherwise it would just sound wrong. To tackle that, each channel has a large control, usually called a fader, with which you can control the volume of that channel.\nEqualization\nAn important part of a mixing engineers work is to make sure the different instruments have enough space of their own in the frequency domain. This is a bit hard to explain with words, so let me show you an image that hopefully explains this a bit more. If too many instruments share a certain portion of the frequency spectrum, much as if you would paint with lots of different colors in one spot, the sound gets mushy, undefined and often just unpleasant, just as the picture you're painting would turn brown-grey-gooey.\nTo help with that, an Equalizer, often shortened to EQ helps you to shape the frequency spectrum of a sound and thus makes it possible to, for each instrument, emphasize different parts of the spectrum, leading to a cleaner, more defined sound.\nAn EQ is essentially just a bunch of filters, in our case a lowpass and a highpass, that allow you to individually set the volumes for the different parts. With a low pass and a highpass, you can also set the volume of the mid section that's not affected by the filters directly.\n\nCompression\nCompression in this case does not mean data compression. Instead, a compressor changes the dynamic range of a instrument, meaning the difference between quiet and loud sounds. There are many reasons why you would want to do this, but the main reason is that using moderate amounts of compression makes a track sounding more loud.\nCompression works by (more or less) making louder sounds more quiet. For that, the compressor uses a curve like this. Additionally, a compressor usually has a way to change the attack and decay times, meaning the the loudness reduction does not happen instantly but is fading in after the loudness reaches a certain threshold and if the sound gets quieter again, the compressor takes a while to dial back the signal reduction. This makes it possible to use a compressor not only for actually compressing the dynamic range but also shaping so-called transients, like the attack of a kick drum. If you use a slightly longer attack on the compressor, the signal is not compressed for that time and only ducked down after it, so that the attack of the drum becomes even more pronounced.\nThere's a very popular effect specifically in modern dance music that can also be done with the help of a compressor, which is nowadays often abbreviated as \"sidechaining\" which is weird, because you can sidechain all kinds of effects but if this word is used in isolation, you're probably talking about sidechain compression.\nSidechaining means that instead of letting the actual input signal of the compressor drive the compressor algorhythm, you let it be driven by a different signal, typically a simple kick drum rhythm. Each time the kick drum plays, the compressor kicks into gear and ducks down your original signal.\nIn our machinery, the \"sidechaining\" is actuallly gonna be done slightly different by triggering a simple envelope each time the kick drum is played. It is easier to parameterize and more consistent and in a lot of productions, the sidechaining effect is actually done in a similar way now.\nInsert effects\nOn a hardware mixer, the number of insert effects per channel is usually limited, as you need a way to actually physically connect these effects. In software, the limit is usually CPU power. As we're not really striving for realtime performance, we're more or less only limited by the amount of time we want to spend on processing.\nWe can essentially insert any form of processing here we have in mind. For our small example, we're going to stick with two effects for now.\nThe first one is a very simple effect, a so called waveshaper. The function of a waveshaper is really hard to describe in words, which is why a picture is in order: The x axis is the input value and the y axis is the output value.\nA generalized waveshaper would allow you to specify any transformation curve you want, in our case, we're simply using a function with a parameter which allows us to specify the amount of distortion we want to apply. The formula is dead simple:\ndef simple_waveshaper(input, a)\n  input * (input.abs + a) / (input ** 2 + (a - 1) * input.abs + 1)\nend\n\nWe're going to use the waveshaper in a rather subtle way on the kick drum as this will give our synthesized kick drum a little bit more punch.\nThe second effect we're going to take a look at is a chorus effect. The idea behind the chorus effect (hence the name) is to simulate the effect of multiple voices \"singing\" together. The reason a choir sounds so powerful is actually the tiny little imperfections in the voicing which lead to interferences between different voices. This makes the choir sound \"fatter\" in the lack of a better term.\nthe way a chorus achieves this is by running half of the signal through a tiny delay and then slightly modulating the delay time. Especially with synth lines, this does make the result sound a lot fatter.\nSend effects\nSend effects send a portion of the channel strip signal to another channel that is specialized in a specific effect. Two things very often used as send effects are Reverb and Delay, both effects to create the illusion of space. Since you probably, for consistency reasons, want these to sound similar for every channel, it makes sense to simply instantiate them once and then use from every channel.\nA delay, in it's simplest form from a code perspective is just a ring buffer, where the length of the buffer is equal to the desired delay time. What you probably need to add to that to get to the specific echo sound is adding some feedback where the output signal is mixed back into the input, thus creating these recurring echoes that get quieter and quiter as time progresses. If you want to get fancy, you can add a filter to that feedback, shaping the frequency spectrum of the feedback loop.\nA reverb is essentially trying to simulate the response a room gives if you make some sound in it. It could be a small room or it could be a cathedral. The reverberation in a real room is created by the sound bouncing off the walls in all kinds of fuzzy ways. Essentially what you have is a huge collection of tiny echoes all adding up and crossfeeding, returning back a muddy but also really really pleasant (usually) version of the original sound. Also: The bigger the room, the longer the reverb.\nTo emulate this in software we essentially have two choices: Using actual reverb data from real places with a technique called convolution or trying to get as close as possible to the real thing with a combination of echoes and filters.\nConvolution reverb works by recording a so called impulse response from an actual room. You would do that by creating an impulse, a very sharp, quick sound and playing it back very loudly and then recording the response of the room. If you are then able to subtract the original impulse from that response, you're left with the actual impulse response you can use for the convolution.\nThe idea of convolution is simple: For each sample, simply multiply it with each sample of the impulse response. But you can also see how this quickly falls apart: This is a very compute intensive operation. By using a bunch of tricks we can make it more viable and for example the Web Audio API actually has a convolver node that can do this without heavily taxing the CPU, but it also comes with the additional burden of you having to keep these impulse responses around.\nFor a long time, using convolving wasn't even an option, because computing power wasn't as readily available as it is today, which is why a lot of techniques exist to create reverb effects with simpler measures.\nUsually it involves creating a bunch of delay lines with random placement within the desired reverb time and then using various techniques to muddle things up. I've ported a popular open source reverb, which is also used in SonicPi, GVerb, to ruby, which you can find in lib/g_verb.rb if you're interested in the details.\nThe main mix\nThe main mix channel simply gives you the possibiliy to adjust the final volume again, so that the output signal is in a good range and you probably have a sum compressor on it as well, to further reduce the dynamic range. For safety we'll also add a hard limiter, which, by brute force, just makes sure the end result never leaves the -1 ... 1 range.\n"},"04_drums.html":{"url":"04_drums.html","title":"Making Drums","keywords":"","body":"Drum Sounds\nWe're now perfectly equipped to create some lush or harsh synthesizer sounds, so we should be able to make some good ambient music. But while I do like me some good ambient, I'm more of a dance music kind of guy and for that we're missing an important part. Now, I could cheat here and just use sampling - That's what most dance music producers nowadays do, but that would be cheating, right?\nAdditionally, if you look at how music styles like House and Techno came about, they were literally based on the sounds of two drum machines, both from Roland, the TR-808 and the TR-909 - The 808 is using analog synthesis for everything while the 909 uses a limited amount of samples - So generating drums with the sythesizing technologies we've explored so far would give us a good understanding of how these machines worked.\nKick drum\nLet's start with the foundation of every house or techno groove, the bassdrum or kickdrum. If you analyze the sound of an accoustic kick drum (or basically any drum with a similar design with a drum head and a drum corpus), as if you were a Roland engineer in the 80's, you'll notice two very distinct parts of a drum sound. The sharp attack, when the drum stick hits the skin of the drum head, which is really more like a shark click and then the sound of the drum body, where the full body including the two skins (and the air trapped in them) vibrates.\nTo simulate these two parts, We can use a sine wave (or a filtered down squarewave) and quickly modulate it's pitch from a relatively high value to a relatively low value. By varying the speed and the two frequencies, we can get a surprising amout of different percussion sounds and some of them do sound like a bassdrum.\nIn this example, I've also modulated the filter in a way so that it is a bit more open at the very beginning, adding to that sharpness of the first attack.\nSnare drum\nA snare drum is, together with the kick drum, the backbone of every rock groove. What a snare drum is, esentially, is a tom, so a midsized drum, that has a so called snare carpet that lies on the bottom drum skin. This leads to the characteristic noisy sound of a snare that is much more than just the sound of the drum, which would sound like this.\nTo construct a snare sound, we pretty much need two components - A version of our kick drum sound that is just slightly pitched up (as a smaller drum usually creates a higher pitche sounds), like this, and then something to emulate the snares. To me, this actually sounds a lot like white noise and so that's what we're going to use. White noise is surprisingly easy to create:\nnoise_out = rand * 2.0 - 1.0\n\nOn top of that, we're going to emulate the snare wires being a bit more bright in the beginning and then dampening down while they settle by putting a lowpass filter on top with an envelope shaping the sound a little it. Of course I aso put another envelope on the volume.\nHihat\nThis is our last drum sound. The hihat, in a traditional drum kit, looks like this - It's essentially two cymbals on top of each other and you can move them together with a foot pedal, resulting in either very short or longer sounds.\nOur hihat emulation will be somewhat crude, but it will actually work quite well within the groove we want to build with this.\nAgain, we'll start with white noise. Having a shorter or longer decay on our volume envelope gives us the chance to emulate an open or a closed hihat. By adding a static filter, a bandpass in this case, we can sort of tune the noise into something that at least starts to sound like a real hihat. To be honest, in my own music, I often favour these clean sounding hihats to accoustic ones.\n"}}}
