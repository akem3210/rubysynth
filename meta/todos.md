## Sound base class
- Fix monosynth note length bug

- This could probably improved by giving Sound a sense of time and a reset method, so that we can store the active events as a class var and then also delete events from that list if we feel like it (for example, if we know a sound has definitely ended. A reset would clear the list and start from scratch
